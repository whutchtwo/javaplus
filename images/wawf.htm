<p>To transmit your Advance Ship Notice (ASN) to Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF), you provide us your current WAWF User ID, but NOT your password.<br/><br/>	  
Thus, we have no access to your WAWF account. The WAWF User ID is all we need for the EDI of your RFID pack data to your WAWF Receiving Report.
