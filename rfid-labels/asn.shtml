            <p>DFARS 252.211-7006  requires the RFID numbers of every case and pallet bearing RFID to be appended to your Receiving Report at WAWF.   Manual 'fat-fingering' of the 24 character RFID data strings can be done, but it's...</p>
            <ul>
            	<li>Time consuming and error-prone</li> 
                <li>Inconvenient as WAWF forces you to complete all data entry in a single session</li>
                <li>Deeply frustrating when WAWF terminates your session without cause or warning and you have to start all over again.  It just makes you want to shoot something.</li>

                <h4>How <em>EXPEDITER</em> ASN works</h4>
                <p>After each purchase of <em>EXPEDITER</em> RFID labels, we email an <em>EXPEDITER</em> ASN link. With a few clicks, you tell us which ASNs to upload to WAWF and when. We track which ASNs have been uploaded and which have not. Within 1 business day, we upload ASNs for every shipment of any contract and any order you selected.</p>            
                <h4><em>EXPEDITER</em> ASN reminder emails</h4>
                <p>Don't hunt for your <em>EXPEDITER</em> ASN email, another will come as often as you want (or not at all). You decide how often at your <em>EXPEDITER</em> account.</p>
                <h4><em>EXPEDITER</em> ASN/Self service</h4>
                <p>Don't want reminder emails...no problem. Your <em>EXPEDITER</em> ASN waits for you 24x7 at your <em>EXPEDITER</em> account.</p>

                <h4>FAQ's</h4> 
                <p><strong>How does <em>EXPEDITER</em> ASN get my RFID data to the right place?</strong><br>
                When you sign up for <em>EXPEDITER</em> you give us your WAWF User ID which serves as the electronic address for your data.</p>            
                <p><strong>Does Compliance label Service access my WAWF account?</strong><br>
                No. We do not have your WAWF password and thus cannot access your WAWF account.</p>
                <p><strong>What method do you use to upload the data to WAWF?</strong><br>
                We use an 856 Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transmission via a Value Added Network (VAN).</p>
