                <dd><p>Orders for RFID and Container labels received before Noon (Eastern Time) M-F are processed and shipped the same business day.

                <dt><a href="#">What are my shipping options?</a></dt>

                <dt><a href="#">How are <em>EXPEDITER&trade;</em> labels inspected and tested?</a></dt>
                <dd><p>Every <em>EXPEDITER&trade;</em> label is inspected by human eye for visual defects and readability of the text. Linear barcodes are sampled for verification.</p>
                <p>For RFID labels, the RFID is tested & verified as functioning properly three times:</p>
                <ol>
					<li>By our supplier, the label converter</li>
					<li>By our RFID printers (before encoding, in near field)</li>
					<li>By our RFID readers (after encoding, in far field, at 12' read distance)</li>
				</ol>
                <p>For UID labels, the 2D Data Matrix barcode is both validated and verified per MIL-STD-130 and ECC200 standards. The data content of the Data Matrix barcode is validated by decoding with an automated reader programmed to check syntax. In addition, the print quality of the Data Matrix barcode is inspected with vision verification equipment to meet ISO15415, AS9132 or AIM-DPM-12006. Sample sizes are a minimum of 25% for quantities less than 100; 10% for quantities greater than 100.</p></dd>
                
                <dt><a href="#">Do you supply a Certificate of Compliance?</a></dt>
                <dd><p>Yes. RFID labels are supplied with a detailed Certificate of Compliance indicating conformance with MIL-STD-129. UID labels are supplied with a detailed Certificate of Compliance indicating conformance with MIL-STD-130. Our Certificates of Compliance have been universally accepted by our customers' Government QAR's.</p></dd>
                
                <dt><a href="#">How are the <em>EXPEDITER&trade;</em> labels packaged?</a></dt>
                <dd><p>RFID and Container labels are collated by pallet, placed in a static shielding bag, wrapped in static resistant bubble wrap and packaged in a FedEx cardboard envelope or corrugated box. UID labels are placed in a sealed plastic bag, cushioned as required and packaged in a FedEx cardboard envelope or corrugated box.</p></dd>
                
                <dt><a href="#">How do I apply the <em>EXPEDITER&trade;</em> labels safely?</a></dt>
                <dd><p>Instructions for where to place and how to apply EXPEDITER™ labels are provided at <em>EXPEDITER</em> account.</p></dd>
                
                <dt><a href="#">Which Federal Supply Classes require RFID labels?</a></dt>
                <dd><p>For a listing of Federal Supply Classes and the year the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) mandate began for each Class, visit: <a href="http://www.acq.osd.mil/log/rfid/r_class_supply_tool.html">www.acq.osd.mil/log/rfid/r_class_supply_tool.html</a></p></dd>
                
                <dt><a href="#">Which 'ship to' locations require RFID?</a></dt>
                <dd><p>The DoD maintains an updated list of ‘ship to’ locations requiring RFID per DFARS Clause 252.211-7006 at <a href="http://www.acq.osd.mil/log/rfid/r_dfars_list.html" target="_blank">http://www.acq.osd.mil/log/rfid/r_dfars_list.html</a>. However, you MUST read your individual contract carefully, because additional locations requiring RFID may be identified for specific shipments.</p></dd>
                
                <dt><a href="#">What do I need to know about ASN and WAWF?</a></dt>
                <dd><p>The DoD requires the RFID numbers of each case and pallet bearing RFID labels to be appended to the WAWF Receiving Report of the associated DoD contract. This can be done manually by 'fat fingering' the data at the WAWF website or it can be done electronically. Because each RFID number consists of a string of 24 characters, manual data entry of more than a couple RFID numbers is a time-consuming, error prone process. Furthermore, all input must be completed in a single session and WAWF is prone to terminate input sessions without warning, forcing the frustrated user to re-start the manual input from the beginning.</p>
                <p>With the <strong><em>EXPEDITER&trade;</em> 3-CLICK ASN</strong>, we electronically upload your ASN's for you. We email you a <strong>3-CLICK ASN</strong> link after each <strong><em>EXPEDITER&trade;</em></strong> purchase of RFID labels. You click the link, select any shipment whose ASN's you want uploaded and pay via credit card or DrawDown 	account. We do the rest. Within 1 business day, we upload the ASN data for every shipment from any contract you selected. The RFID numbers are correct and the data is appended to the Receiving Report of the right contract!</p>
                <p>For your convenience, we also keep track of which shipments have not had their RFID numbers uploaded to WAWF. We email you a <strong>3-CLICK ASN reminder email</strong> as often as you want or not at all to enable you to click the <strong>3-CLICK ASN link</strong> whenever shipments are ready. If you prefer, the <strong>3-CLICK ASN link</strong> is also available to you 24x7 at <em>My&nbsp;ComplianceCenter.</em></p></dd>
                
                <dt><a href="#">How can I change my contact or mailing information?</a></dt>
                <dd><p>Labels are shipped to the contact person and address input at <em>EXPEDITER</em> account during sign up. To update this information, just login and change them. To redirect a single order, input the temporary 'ship to' address on the comment line of that order.</p></dd>
