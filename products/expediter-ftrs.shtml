                Our interactive order form interviews you and informs you which labels 
                MIL-STD-129 requires for your shipment. It only collects data for 
                labels you want to buy.  A special 'Look up' feature allows you to 
                check if DFARS requires RFID for your 'Ship-to' destination.
