			<h1>Make submitting to the IUID Registry easy</h1>
			<p><img src="/images/uid-reg-collage.gif" width="292" height="214" class="left">The IUID Registry is DoD's central repository for all UID data.  DFARS 252.211-7003 requires DoD suppliers to submit all UII's (i.e. UID numbers). Typing at WAWF or the IUID Registry is error prone, frustrating and time consuming.  <em>EXPEDITER</em>&trade; IUID Registry service replaces hours of typing with a single electronic submission to the IUID Registry. See <a href="/resources/CLSUIDRegistryService.pdf">brochure</a>.</p>
			<h2>UID's submitted in 48 hours</h2>
			<p>Within 48 hours of collecting the required data, EXPEDITER&trade; UID Registry Service submits it to the IUID Registry via Electronic Data Interchange. Done!</p>

			<h2>Low prices</h2>
