                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            </hgroup>
            <p>To save our customers time, keystrokes and money in achieving DoD and GSA compliance, speeding shipments to the warfighter and payments from DoD.</p>            
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p><strong>Compliance Label Service</strong> is a division of
            Productivity by RFID, LLC, a CCR-registered small business
            founded in 2003 by Robert Steinberg. In 2003, both Wal-Mart and
            the DoD had announced RFID mandates for suppliers. While most
            RFID start-ups focused on the top 100 Wal-Mart suppliers,
            Steinberg and the Board of Productivity by RFID (PbR), focused on
            DoD suppliers. Board member Colonel William Herbert, USAF (ret),
            a former Deputy Chief of the Defense Logistics Agency, provided
            invaluable guidance. Board members, Lenny Landau and Jay Celesti,
            retired executives of GE Aerospace, contributed PbR's passion for
            execution and customer service. Board member Harvey Steinberg
            raised the capital required to fund start up.</p>
            <p>After PbR presented several widely acclaimed RFID seminars for
            DoD suppliers, the National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA)
            selected PbR to create and run a seminar series in cities across
            the US for NDIA members. Feedback gained from interactions with
            hundreds of DoD suppliers, coupled with the ingenuity of Board
            member Joseph Blake, a pioneer of the barcode industry, resulted
            in the birth of <em>EXPEDITER</em>&trade;. Shipper&trade; followed
            shortly. In 2007, Rob Steinberg placed all DoD-related activities
            of Productivity by RFID under the Compliance Label Service
            division and it rapidly evolved into a full-service compliance company serving DoD and GSA suppliers nationwide.</p>
            <h2>Founder</h2>
            <p>Prior to founding Productivity by RFID, Rob Steinberg spent nine
            years leading growth initiatives at Avery Dennison, a Fortune 500
            label and systems company. Rob became involved with RFID while
            leading the marketing effort of a multi-division team assessing
            needs for inventory tracking, anti-diversion, anti-theft,
            homeland security, brand protection and rebate fraud. He also
            founded and led a new division to develop, manufacture and sell
            printed electronic displays. His division was showcased to Wall
            Street on two occasions. Rob holds two patents: one in RFID
            systems for tracking, displaying and storing inventories of small
            retail items; the other in electrochromic displays. Rob has two
            engineering degrees and an MBA from M.I.T.</p>
